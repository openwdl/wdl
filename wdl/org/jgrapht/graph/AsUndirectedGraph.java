/**
 * An undirected view of the backing directed graph specified in the
 * constructor. This graph allows modules to apply algorithms designed for
 * undirected graphs to a directed graph by simply ignoring edge direction. If
 * the backing directed graph is an <a
 * href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/OrientedGraph.html">oriented graph</a>,
 * then the view will be a simple graph; otherwise, it will be a multigraph.
 * Query operations on this graph "read through" to the backing graph. Attempts
 * to add edges will result in an <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code>,
 * but vertex addition/removal and edge removal are all supported (and
 * immediately reflected in the backing graph).
 *
 * <p>Note that edges returned by this graph's accessors are really just the
 * edges of the underlying directed graph. Since there is no interface
 * distinction between directed and undirected edges, this detail should be
 * irrelevant to algorithms.</p>
 *
 * <p>This graph does <i>not</i> pass the hashCode and equals operations through
 * to the backing graph, but relies on <tt>Object</tt>'s <tt>equals</tt> and
 * <tt>hashCode</tt> methods. This graph will be serializable if the backing
 * graph is serializable.</p>
