    /**
     * Generate a graph structure. The topology of the generated graph is
     * dependent on the implementation. For graphs in which not all vertices
     * share the same automorphism equivalence class, the generator may produce
     * a labeling indicating the roles played by generated elements. This is the
     * purpose of the resultMap parameter. For example, a generator for a wheel
     * graph would designate a hub vertex. Role names used as keys in resultMap
     * should be declared as public static final Strings by implementation
     * classes.
     *
     * @param target receives the generated edges and vertices; if this is
     * non-empty on entry, the result will be a disconnected graph since
     * generated elements will not be connected to existing elements
     * @param vertexFactory called to produce new vertices
     * @param resultMap if non-null, receives implementation-specific mappings
     * from String roles to graph elements (or collections of graph elements)
