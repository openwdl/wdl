/**
 * The root interface in the graph hierarchy. A mathematical graph-theory graph
 * object <tt>G(V,E)</tt> contains a set <tt>V</tt> of vertices and a set <tt>
 * E</tt> of edges. Each edge e=(v1,v2) in E connects vertex v1 to vertex v2.
 * for more information about graphs and their related definitions see <a
 * href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Graph.html">
 * http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Graph.html</a>.
 *
 * <p>This library generally follows the terminology found at: <a
 * href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/topics/GraphTheory.html">
 * http://mathworld.wolfram.com/topics/GraphTheory.html</a>. Implementation of
 * this interface can provide simple-graphs, multigraphs, pseudographs etc. The
 * package <code>org.jgrapht.graph</code> provides a gallery of abstract and
 * concrete graph implementations.</p>
 *
 * <p>This library works best when vertices represent arbitrary objects and
 * edges represent the relationships between them. Vertex and edge instances may
 * be shared by more than one graph.</p>
 *
 * <p>Through generics, a graph can be typed to specific classes for vertices
 * <code>V</code> and edges <code>E&lt;T&gt;</code>. Such a graph can contain
 * vertices of type <code>V</code> and all sub-types and Edges of type <code>
 * E</code> and all sub-types.</p>
 *
 * <p>For guidelines on vertex and edge classes, see <a
