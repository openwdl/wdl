/**
 * <b>Isomorphism Overview</b>
 *
 * <p>Isomorphism is the problem of testing whether two graphs are topologically
 * the same. Suppose we are given a collection of graphs and must perform some
 * operation on each of them. If we can identify which of the graphs are
 * duplicates, they can be discarded so as to avoid redundant work.
 *
 * <p>In Formal Math: <i>Input description:</i> Two graphs, G and H. <i>Problem
 * description:</i> Find a (or all) mappings f of the vertices of G to the
 * vertices of H such that G and H are identical; i.e. (x,y) is an edge of G iff
 * (f(x),f(y)) is an edge of H. <a

 * http://www2.toki.or.id/book/AlgDesignManual/BOOK/BOOK4/NODE180.HTM</a>.
 *
 * <p><i>Efficiency:</i> The general algorithm is not polynomial, however
 * polynomial algorithms are known for special cases, like acyclic graphs,
 * planar graphs etc. There are several heuristic algorithms which gives quite
 * good results (polynomial) in general graphs, for most but not all cases.
 *
 * <p><b>Usage:</b>
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>Choose comparators for the vertexes and edges. You may use the default
 * comparator by sending null parameters for them to the constructor. Example:
 * Assume Your graphs are of human relations. Each vertex is either a man or a
 * woman and also has the person name. You may decide that isomorphism is
 * checked according to gender, but not according to the specific name. So you
 * will create a comparator that distinguishes vertexes only according to
 * gender.
 * <li>Use the isIsomorphic() method as a boolean test for isomorphism
 * <li>Use the Iterator interface to iterate through all the possible
 * isomorphism ordering.
 * </ol>
