Beginning with version 1.1.1, most of the examples in the WDL specification represent test cases.
All of these tests conform to the [WDL Markdown Test Specification](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl-tests/docs/MarkdownTests.md).
The tests extracted from the WDL specs can be found in the [wdl-tests](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl-tests/spec/) repository.
This folder contains the [test input files](data/) that are referenced by the test cases in the spec.
