## This WDL extracts the headers from a list of SAM/BAMs
##
## Requirements/expectations :
## - List of valid SAM or BAM files
##
## Outputs: 
## - Set of .txt files containing the header, one per input file
##
## Cromwell version support 
## - Successfully tested on v24
## - Does not work on versions < v23 due to output syntax
##
## Runtime parameters are optimized for Broad's Google Cloud Platform implementation. 
## For program versions, see docker containers. 
##
## Note that this is a really dumb way to get a SAM/BAM header when running on GCP 
## because it will require localizing the entire SAM/BAM file, which can take a while. 
## A much better way is to use gsutil like this:
##
##     gsutil cp gs://bucket/path/your.bam - | samtools view -H -
##
## And yes there's a weird trailing dash (-) there at the end; it's not a typo, leave 
## it in. 
##
## If you're running locally or on a cloud platform that doesn't require localizing 
## files then it should be fine.
