/**
 * Factory to create Permutations of several types and use them as Enumerations.
 * Note that callers may use them directly if they need to use special concrete
 * methods.
 *
 * <p>These types are:
 *
 * <p>
 * <li>All elements are different. There are N! possible permutations.
 *
 * <p><i>example:</i> source=[1,2,3]
 * result=[1,2,3][1,3,2][2,1,3][2,3,1][3,1,2][3,2,1]
 *
 * <p>
 * <li>Some of the elements are the same.
 *
 * <p><i>example:</i> source=[1,1,2] result=[1,1,2][1,2,1][2,1,1]
 *
 * <p>
 * <li>There are separate permutations groups, which are connected to one
 * sequence. Permutations are allowed only inside the group. Possible sequences:
 * product of factorial of each group. see example.
 *
 * <p><i>example:</i> assume source=the groups are sizes are : 1,2,2,5 elements
 * will be created: (1),(2,3),(4,5).
 *
 * <p>result=[1,(2,3),(4,5)] [1,(2,3),(5,4)] [1,(3,2),(5,4)] [1,(3,2),(4,5)]. In
 * this example the number of possiblities is 1! x 2! x 2! = 4
