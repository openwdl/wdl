/**
 * This interface distinguishes between Equivalence sets.
 *
 * <p>It is similar, in concept, to the Object.hashcode() and Object.equals()
 * methods, but instead of checking whether two objects are equal, it is used to
 * check whether they are part of the same Equivalence group, where the
 * definition of an "equivalence" is defined by the implementation of this
 * interface.
 *
 * <p>A specific usage of it is shown below, but it may be used outside of the
 * graph-theory class library.
 *
 * <p>In Isomorphism, edges/vertexes matching may relay on none/some/all of the
 * vertex/edge properties. For example, if a vertex representing a person
 * contains two properties: gender(male/female) and person name(string), we can
 * decide that to check isomorphism in vertex groups of gender only. Meaning if
 * this is the graph:
 *
 * <p>(male,"Don")---->(female,"Dana")--->(male,"John")
 *
 * <p>if there is no equivalence set at all , this graph can be described as:
 * (1)---->(2)---->(3)
 *
 * <p>if the equivalence set is determined only by the gender property :
 * (male)---->(female)---->(male)
 *
 * <p>and if it is determined by both properties: (the original figure) The
 * isomorphism inspection may return different result according to this choice.
 * If the other graph is: (male,"Don")--->(male,"Sunny")---->(male,"Jo") In no
 * eq.set they are Isomorphic, but for the two other cases they are not. Other
 * examples: Nodes with the same degree, Edges with the same weight, Graphs with
 * the same number of nodes and edges.
 *
 * @param <E> the type of the elements in the set
 * @param <C> the type of the context the element is compared against, e.g. a
 * Graph
