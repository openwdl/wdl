/**
 * <p>A weighted view of the backing graph specified in the constructor. This
 * graph allows modules to apply algorithms designed for weighted graphs to an
 * unweighted graph by providing an explicit edge weight mapping. The
 * implementation also allows for "masking" weights for a subset of the edges in
 * an existing weighted graph.</p>
 *
 * <p>Query operations on this graph "read through" to the backing graph. Vertex
 * addition/removal and edge addition/removal are all supported (and immediately
 * reflected in the backing graph). Setting an edge weight will pass the
 * operation to the backing graph as well if the backing graph implements the
 * WeightedGraph interface. Setting an edge weight will modify the weight map in
 * order to maintain a consistent graph.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that edges returned by this graph's accessors are really just the
 * edges of the underlying directed graph.</p>
 *
 * <p>This graph does <i>not</i> pass the hashCode and equals operations through
 * to the backing graph, but relies on <tt>Object</tt>'s <tt>equals</tt> and
 * <tt>hashCode</tt> methods. This graph will be serializable if the backing
 * graph is serializable.</p>
