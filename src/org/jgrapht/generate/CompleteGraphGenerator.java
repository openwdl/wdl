/**
 * Generates a complete graph of any size. A complete graph is a graph where
 * every vertex shares an edge with every other vertex. If it is a directed
 * graph, then edges must always exist in both directions. On a side note, a
 * complete graph is the least efficient possible graph in terms of memory and
 * cpu usage. Note: This contructor was designed for a simple undirected or
 * directed graph. It will act strangely when used with certain graph types,
 * such as undirected multigraphs. Note, though, that a complete undirected
 * multigraph is rather senseless -- you can keep adding edges and the graph is
 * never truly complete.
