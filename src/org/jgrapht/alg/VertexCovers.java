/**
 * Algorithms to find a vertex cover for a graph. A vertex cover is a set of
 * vertices that touches all the edges in the graph. The graph's vertex set is a
 * trivial cover. However, a <i>minimal</i> vertex set (or at least an
 * approximation for it) is usually desired. Finding a true minimal vertex cover
 * is an NP-Complete problem. For more on the vertex cover problem, see <a
