/**

 * obtained from {@link Graphs}, they are re-calculated at each invocation by
 * walking a vertex's incident edges, which becomes inordinately expensive when
 * performed often.
 *
 * <p>A vertex's neighbors are cached the first time they are asked for (i.e.
 * the index is built on demand). The index will only be updated automatically
 * if it is added to the associated graph as a listener. If it is added as a
 * listener to a graph other than the one it indexes, results are undefined.</p>
