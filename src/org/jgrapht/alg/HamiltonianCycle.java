    /**
     * This method will return an approximate minimal traveling salesman tour
     * (hamiltonian cycle). This algorithm requires that the graph be complete
     * and the triangle inequality exists (if x,y,z are vertices then
     * d(x,y)+d(y,z)<d(x,z) for all x,y,z) then this algorithm will guarantee a
     * hamiltonian cycle such that the total weight of the cycle is less than or
     * equal to double the total weight of the optimal hamiltonian cycle. The
     * optimal solution is NP-complete, so this is a decent approximation that
     * runs in polynomial time.
     *
     * @param <V>
     * @param <E>
     * @param g is the graph to find the optimal tour for.
     *
     * @return The optimal tour as a list of vertices.
